# mps-entities-tutorial
The Entities Tutorial, amped up with instances and brought to MPS 2020.2.
For earlier versions of MPS, please see the maintenance/mps<version> branch. For versions earlier than 2018.3, please see version history saying "Migrate to ...".

The entitites tutorial is an MPS example that shows a standard pattern for implementing non-trivial data structures with simple and complex types, where complex types can contain complex types again (but also simple types).

If you need this tutorial to work in a certain version, please have a look at the tags!
